Risk mgmt
=====

All cybersecurity risks will be identified, assessed, and mitigated in alignment with the organization’s risk tolerance.

The Risk Management Policy establishes a formal framework for identifying, prioritizing, and addressing risks across IT and OT systems.

Risk assessments will include:

Threat Modeling: Identify potential threat actors and their capabilities.

Impact Analysis: Evaluate the business and operational impact of identified risks.

Likelihood Assessment: Determine the probability of risks materializing.

Mitigation plans will be documented and monitored for effectiveness.

Regular risk reviews will be conducted, incorporating updates to regulatory requirements and threat landscapes.



IR:
===
The Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines step-by-step procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.

Key elements of the IRP include:

Preparation: Maintain tools, technologies, and personnel readiness for incidents.

Detection and Analysis: Use real-time monitoring, automated alerts, and manual reviews to identify incidents.

Containment: Implement containment strategies to isolate affected systems and prevent further damage.

Eradication: Remove malicious artifacts and vulnerabilities from the environment.

Recovery: Restore systems to operational status with validated integrity and security.

Post-incident reviews will be conducted to document lessons learned and improve future response capabilities.

Data and systems protection
===
Measures to safeguard the organization’s data include:

Encryption: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

Access Controls: Enforce role-based access controls and implement multifactor authentication for critical systems.

Data Retention Policies: Define retention and disposal schedules to minimize exposure risks.

Endpoint security tools, such as antivirus software and host intrusion prevention systems (HIPS), will be deployed across IT and OT systems.

Backup solutions will be regularly tested to ensure data availability during recovery efforts.

compliance
===
The organization will comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as NERC-CIP, GDPR, and local privacy regulations.

The Compliance Policy defines procedures for:

Maintaining an inventory of regulatory requirements.

Regularly auditing systems and processes for compliance.

Ensuring policies, procedures, and systems align with external obligations.

Non-compliance incidents will be escalated to the Cybersecurity Governance Committee for resolution.
