Automatic Updates: Some AVEVA products support automatic updates through scheduled events. For instance, in AVEVA Global, users can create update events between pairs of locations to facilitate automatic updates. This setup requires configuration to define the frequency and parameters of the updates.

Manual Updates: Many AVEVA products require manual intervention for updates. Users typically need to download the latest software versions or patches from AVEVA's support portals and manually apply them to their systems. For example, AVEVA's Communication Drivers Pack and System Platform updates are available for download, and users must follow specific installation procedures to update their systems.

Considerations for Your Scenario:

Update Mechanism: Determine whether the AVEVA software in your environment is configured for automatic or manual updates. This information is crucial for accurately simulating the supply chain breach scenario in your tabletop exercise.

Network Connections: Assess whether the software establishes outbound connections to AVEVA servers for updates or other functionalities. Understanding these connections can help in evaluating potential vulnerabilities and the risk of compromised updates.

Internal Policies: Review your organization's policies regarding software updates, especially in critical infrastructure environments. Some organizations prefer manual updates to maintain strict control over changes, while others may opt for automatic updates for efficiency
