Additional ad-hoc training will be conducted following significant incidents or policy updates.

Periodic awareness campaigns (e.g., simulated phishing tests, newsletters, and workshops) will reinforce key practices.

Refer to the Training and Awareness Policy for comprehensive program details.


Monitoring:


Cybersecurity performance will be tracked using detailed metrics, including:

Number and severity of detected vulnerabilities.

Frequency of successful and blocked phishing attempts.

Incident response times and outcomes.

System uptime and availability metrics for critical IT and OT systems.

Security incidents will be logged and monitored in real-time using automated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

Regular reports will be delivered to the Cybersecurity Governance Committee, including trend analyses and recommendations for improvement.
