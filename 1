A trusted third-party vendor that provides software updates for pipeline monitoring and reporting tools notifies your organization about a potential compromise in their software update mechanism.

The OT environment is unaffected directly, but questions arise about the potential for lateral movement or data exfiltration that could impact pipeline operations.
