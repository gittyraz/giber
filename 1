Scenario Summary
A trusted third-party vendor that provides software updates for pipeline monitoring and reporting tools notifies your organization about a potential compromise in their software update mechanism. The vendor reports that malicious actors may have injected backdoors into one of their recent updates. Although your organization has defense-in-depth mechanisms and segmented networks, this update was installed on a server within your IT environment.

The OT environment is unaffected directly, but questions arise about the potential for lateral movement or data exfiltration that could impact pipeline operations.

Injects Timeline
Day 1: Notification of Vendor Compromise
Inject 1: Email from Vendor
"A recent routine update to our [Vendor Software] may have been compromised. We recommend all customers investigate servers where the update was deployed. Additional technical details are attached, including known indicators of compromise (IOCs)."
Focus Area: Evaluate your teamâ€™s ability to investigate IOCs, prioritize potential risks, and assess the affected IT systems.

Inject 2: Alert from EDR Solution
Your EDR solution detects unusual outbound traffic from the server where the update was installed, flagged as potentially malicious.
Focus Area: Validate detection capabilities, analyze traffic patterns, and determine whether the threat is contained within the IT environment.

Day 2: Potential OT Impact
Inject 3: Question from OT Team
"We noticed a minor delay in data being transmitted from the IT system to the pipeline monitoring dashboard. Could this be related to the reported compromise?"
Focus Area: Encourage IT-OT communication to determine whether the delays are related to the incident or an operational issue.

Inject 4: Request from Leadership
The COO requests an impact assessment on potential operational risks. They want to know:

Whether pipeline operations could be affected.
Whether OT data integrity is at risk.
Focus Area: Develop a high-level communication plan to address leadership concerns and ensure alignment between IT and OT priorities.

Day 3: Threat Containment
Inject 5: Suspicious Activity Detected in OT Monitoring
The OT monitoring system detects a login attempt from an IT environment IP address that is unusual and outside normal operating hours.
Focus Area: Investigate the attempted login, confirm whether it represents lateral movement, and ensure that network segmentation is functioning as designed.

Inject 6: Notification from Incident Response Retainer
Your IR retainer team provides preliminary findings: the threat actors likely aimed to establish persistence in the IT environment to exfiltrate data but have not breached OT systems. They recommend a full forensic investigation.
Focus Area: Coordinate incident containment, forensic analysis, and system recovery without disrupting OT operations.

Debrief Objectives
After the exercise, focus on:

Detection and Monitoring: How quickly did the team identify malicious activity, and how effectively were the IOCs used?
IT-OT Collaboration: Were there clear communication and escalation protocols between IT and OT teams?
Incident Management: Was the response plan executed effectively? Were there gaps in containment, communication, or forensic readiness?
Leadership Communication: How well did the teams convey critical information to executives and reassure them about the safety of operations?
Policy and Procedure Review: Did the exercise reveal any weaknesses in network segmentation, zero trust policies, or incident response workflows?


This scenario provides an opportunity to test collaboration, response, and leadership communication without overwhelming participants. It aligns with the organization's strong defense-in-depth posture while highlighting potential gaps in detection and monitoring capabilities.
